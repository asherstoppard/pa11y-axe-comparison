# Pa11y Report

Outputs a formatted pa11y report from an array of routes.

## To Do

- Throw exit code 0 in the reporter (Currently the report generation would pass the pipline)
- Need a way of reading URL's/Base URL's from configuration
- Need a binary to run the package in the dps codebase
- Need's a whitelisting process
- Need's testing on the VM's for memory allocation issues (As seen in the pa11y lib)
- Report could be more user friendly
